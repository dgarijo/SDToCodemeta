# SDToCodemeta
Simple repository to transform entries from the software description ontology to Codemeta

The script is a very initial approach to transform a softeare in the MINT model catalog (http://models.mint.isi.edu/). In order for the script to work you need to pass a model id from any of the models of the API listed in the script. 

This is an example on how the transformation works for a model called Topoflow. This will be available on online model catalog in a future release.
